                <p>
                    Java is a high-level, class-based, 
                    bject-oriented programming language
                     that is designed to have as few implementation 
                     dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose 
                     programming language intended to let application developers
                      write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
                    Java without the need for recompilation.
                </p>
                <p>The “Hello World” program is the first
                    step towards learning any programming
                    language and also one of the simplest
                    programs you will learn. All you have
                    to do is display the message “Hello World”
                    on the screen.
                    <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>

                <code>
                    public class HelloWorldApp{<iostream>
                    <br>
                    public static void main(String[] args){
    
                
                            <br>
                            system.outprintln("Hello World") }

                <p>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                    <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented

                    Inheritance
                </header>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is the ability of one object to
                     acquire some/all properties of another object.
                      For example, a child inherits the traits of 
                      his/her parents. With inheritance, reusability 
                      is a major advantage. You can reuse the fields
                       and methods of the existing class. In Java,
                        there are various types of inheritances: single, 
                    multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid.
                     For example, Apple is a fruit so assume that 
                     we have a class Fruit and a subclass of it named 
                     Apple. Our Apple acquires the properties of the 
                     Fruit class. Other classifications could be grape, 
                     pear, and mango, etc. Fruit defines a class of foods
                      that are mature ovaries of a plant, fleshy, contains
                      a large seed within or numerous tiny seeds. Apple
                       the sub-class acquires these properties from Fruit 
                       and has some unique properties, which are different
                        from other sub-classes of Fruit such as red,
                     round, depression at the top.

                    <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

                    <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
                    class from a public base class. Then the
                    public member of the base class will
                    become public in the derived class and
                    protected members of the base class
                    will become protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub class from a Protected base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    protected in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub class from a Private base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    Private in derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Types of Inheritance in Java : </b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
                    inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
                    from only one class. i.e. one sub class
                    is inherited by one base class only.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
                    Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
                    class can inherit from more than one
                    classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
                    from more than one base classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, a derived class is
                    created from another derived class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, more than one sub
                    class is inherited from a single base
                    class i.e. more than one derived class
                    is created from a single base class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
                    Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
                    combining more than one type of
                    inheritance.
                    For example: Combining Hierarchical
                    inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

                <header>
                    Polymorphism
                </header>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism gives us a way to use a 
                    class exactly like its parent so there
                     is no confusion with mixing types. This 
                     being said, each child sub-class keeps its own 
                     functions/methods as they are. If we had a 
                     superclass called Mammal that has a method 
                     called mammalSound(). The sub-classes of Mammals 
                     could be Dogs, whales, elephants, and horses. 
                     Each of these would have their own iteration of 
                     a mammal sound 
                    (dog-barks, whale-clicks).

                    <b>In Java polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
                    2. Runtime Polymorphism
                </p>

                <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
                    polymorphism is achieved by function
                    overloading or operator overloading.
                    <br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
                    of polymorphism is achieved by
                    Function Overriding.

                <header>
                    Abstraction
                </header>

                <p>
                    Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. I
                    t is the process of selecting data from a
                     larger pool to show only the relevant details 
                     to the object. <br> Suppose you want to create a
                      dating application and you are asked to 
                      collect all the information about your users. 
                      You might receive the following data from 
                      your user: Full name, address, phone number, 
                      favorite food, favorite movie, hobbies, t
                      ax information, social security number, 
                      credit score. This amount of data is great 
                      however not all of it is required to create 
                      a dating profile. You only need to select the 
                      information that is pertinent to your dating 
                      application from that pool. Data like Full name,
                       favorite food, favorite movie, and hobbies make 
                       sense for a dating application. The process of 
                       fetching/removing/selecting the user information 
                       from a larger pool is referred to as Abstraction. One of the advantages of Abstraction is being able to apply the same information you used for the dating application to other applications
                     with little or no modification. 

                <p>
                    <b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
                    implement Abstraction in Java using classes.
                    Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A
                    Class can decide which data member will be
                    visible to outside
                    world and which is not.
                    <br>
                    <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
                    more type of abstraction in Java can be
                    header files. For example, consider the
                    pow() method present in math.h header file.
                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the
                    function pow() present in the math.h header
                    file and pass the numbers as arguments
                    without knowing the underlying algorithm
                    according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.
                    <br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

                    </b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
                    the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
                    duplication and increases reusability.<br>
                    3. Can change internal implementation of
                    class independently without
                    affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
                    increase security of an application or program
                    as only important details are

            <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
                <header>
                    Encapsulation
                </header>
                <p>
                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                    as wrapping up of data and information
                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                    binding together the data and the functions
                    that manipulates them. Consider
                    a real life example
                    of encapsulation, in a company there are
                    different sections like the accounts section,
                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions
                    and keep records of all the data related to
                    finance.
                    Similarly the sales section handles all the
                    sales related activities and keep records of
                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a
                    particular
                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section.
                    He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then
                    request him to
                    give the particular data. This is what
                    encapsulation is. Here the data of
                    sales section and the
                    employees that can manipulate them are
                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
                    or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
                    the data. In the above example the data of
                    any of the section like sales, finance or
                    accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
                    In C++ encapsulation
                    can be implemented using Class
                    and access modifiers.
